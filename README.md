## Environment Tests

The three environment tests are test_empty_env.py, test_small_package.py, and test_large_package.py, which test environment creation with different sizes of environments. These can be modified as necessary to run through environment creation an arbitrary number of times, and the test programs can be changed to import different libraries, import multiple libraries, etc.
